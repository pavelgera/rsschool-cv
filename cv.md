describe("Sample tests", function() {

  it("Should pass Sample tests", function() {

    Test.assertDeepEquals(arrayDiff([], [4,5]), [], "a was [], b was [4,5]");
    Test.assertDeepEquals(arrayDiff([3,4], [3]), [4], "a was [3,4], b was [3]");
    Test.assertDeepEquals(arrayDiff([1,8,2], []), [1,8,2], "a was [1,8,2], b was []");
    Test.assertDeepEquals(arrayDiff([1,2,3], [1,2]), [3], "a was [1,2,3], b was [1,2]")
